# whats_next-Test

This project was given to me by the CTO Xavier de Maillard of Pongo as a test for a work-study program. I had to create a website made to display to someone landing to NYC, all the restaurants near his hotel the "Moxy NYC Times Square" located in 485 7th Ave, New York, NY 10018. 
It shows 30 restaurants with an image, their name, their address, their prices, thair rating and the Yelp Url leading to the restaurant's Yelp page.
